/**
 * RELMED Task Battery - Messages Module
 * 
 * This module contains standardized messages and instructions displayed to participants
 * during different phases of the RELMED experiment sessions. It includes:
 * 
 * - Start and end messages for different session types (full_battery, screening)
 * - Formatted warning messages for response timeouts
 * - Dynamic content based on session settings (e.g., week 0 vs other weeks)
 * 
 * The messages support HTML formatting and can include optional fields passed on to the jsPsych instructions trial object.
